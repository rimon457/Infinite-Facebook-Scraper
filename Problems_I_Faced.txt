One should do the following to avoid being blocked by Facebook network as a bot while scrapping.
1.Customized User-Agent on web driver
2.Customized Referrer
3.Using dynamic intervals to scrape
4.Not firing request too quickly rather waiting
5.Using dynamic proxies

main problem seems that web drivers do not update options on the fly after a session has been initiated. Hence i failed to change the User-Agent and proxy dynamically.
May be some kind of header needs to be injected to change UA/proxies on the fly in the same session.
